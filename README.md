# TextosCuanticosLMS
This contains the frontend code for my LMS (Learning Management System) It is part of my personal project within the framework of my studies in the ADSO (Software Analysis and Development) Program at SENA. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interface for learners.
